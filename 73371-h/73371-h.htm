<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> tall and stately plant has ever been regarded, in this country, as
an object of sufficient interest and curiosity to merit an exposure in
the form of an exhibition; whilst in the southern parts of Spain and
Portugal they are so abundant as to form hedges, by way of barriers to
repress the inroads of cattle. There are several very slight varieties;
one of whose leaves are edged with yellow, but the same in every other
respect. Miller enumerates one whose paniculated flowers bear a very
different aspect. Cortusus is said to be the first European that
possessed this great Aloe, about the year 1561: in 1714 two flowered at
Hampton Court, and one at the duke of Buckingham’s. At Friedericksberg,
in Denmark, one flowered with 19 branches and 4000 flowers; and one in
the king of Prussia’s garden, said to be 40 feet high. They are now more
frequently found in bloom, as rarely a year passes without one or more
of them being advertised for public inspection. In addition to their
grand exterior, they possess many useful properties: Cavanilles, in his
Natural History of Valentia, mentions their abundance, and the numbers
of people employed in manufacturing them; for, when bruised, separated,
and steeped in water, they yield a strong thread, of which all the bags
are made in which dollars are imported. The juice of the leaves is said
to be used as a succedaneum for soap, and the spungy substance of the
stem for tinder. The points of the leaves are by the Indians made use of
to head their arrows, whose hard consistence is a good substitute for
iron; and the thready character of their fibres furnishes all that is
necessary to fasten them. Linnæus has separated this genus from Aloe,
from the extension of the stamens and style beyond the corolla, and the
resting of the corolla on the germ: they also differ in growth, as all
Agaves have their central leaves closely enfoliating and embracing the
flower-stem, which, forming in the centre, never appears till they are
expanded; it then proceeds with a rapidity that in a few weeks reaches
maturity, and when the flowers are past the plant dies. On the contrary,
the flower-stem of the Aloe comes out from the side annually from the
same plant. Our figure was made from two plants at Kensington Gore, each
bearing 2000 flowers, and about 70 years old, belonging to J. Vere, Esq.
who perfectly recollects them for above half a century: but in those
warmer climes, where they are so abundant, 25 or 30 years are sufficient
to bring them to perfection.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> lively little Dwarf Pultenæa we have not as yet seen any where but
in the conservatory of G. Hibbert, Esq. where, contrasted with many
large magnificent plants, its minute and diminutive form made a
perfectly unique appearance. When we first observed it, its height did
not exceed an inch and a half. Our figure represents the whole plant,
which for six months was in progressive constant bloom, and after
flowering ripened its seeds freely; an evident proof of the plant being
in a state of perfection. It is now three months since the plant
perfected its seeds, during which period we have not perceived the least
increase in its size. But, notwithstanding this apparent torpidity, it
is now exhibiting the buds of its future blossoms. It has been imagined
by some to be the Chorizema of Billardiere, a new plant found by that
gentleman in New South Wales whilst in search of the unfortunate La
Perouse; but, upon comparing it with the figure in that work, we do not
find a sufficient resemblance to induce us to regard it as the same
plant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

as it is at least six months in successive bloom. It is one of those
Verbenas that, differing a little from the general character of that
genus, has received various titles from different botanists: by
Professor Vahl, in his Enumeratio Plantarum, it is called
Stachytarpheta. The present species has been recently figured in the
Paradisus Londinensis under the title of Cymburus mutabilis, and
probably at some future period it may again receive another title: but
until we can find some better path to lead us into the open plain or
Information, we shall keep jogging on in the old beaten track, in
preference to every crooked turning that may bewilder us into the mazy
labyrinth of affected Science. Our figure was made from a fine plant in

alba, but is the only addition to this genus as yet in cultivation with
us, and as such deserving notice. It has been already figured in the
Exotic Botany of Dr. Smith, but very imperfectly, as it is there
represented with only two divisions in the corolla instead of four, and
six antheræ instead of eight&mdash;a deficiency we have not met with: and
although we have examined a number of living and dried specimens, yet we
have always found it perfect in those characters essential to the genus.
The only variation we have ever observed has been sometimes a
super-abundance of petals in the corolla; (instead of a deficiency) five
instead of four, a frequent occurrence in many genera when the plant is
in a state of luxuriant growth: and certainly little illustration, but
much confusion, might probably arise from giving a figure from any
specimen so very defective. We find this genus published by Billardiere
under the title Mazeutoxeron&mdash;our present figure under the specific of
rufum&mdash;an excellent specific, were it not a striking feature in every
species of this genus, living or dried, that we have as yet seen. Our
figure was made from a plant in the collection of G. Hibbert, Esq.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

enlivened by such brilliant red stalks, as, in addition to its flower,
render it an attractive object: nor is it so difficult to preserve as

the Hortus Kewensis under the name of Protea speciosa, but the plant
itself has been long lost to those gardens. Thunberg, in his
dissertation on Protea, describes our plant exactly, under the
appellation of speciosa: and, that no doubt might remain with respect to
the specific adopted, our figure has been compared with a remarkable
fine specimen in the herbarium of A. B. Lambert, esq., sent by Dr.
Roxburgh from the Cape of Good Hope under the title of “Protea speciosa
of Hottentot Island.” It is undoubtedly one of the grandest of this fine
section of Protea; for as a section of this numerous family it will
always be better understood than it can possibly be as a discriminative
specific. This extended tribe will, we think, admit of at least four or
five partitions, but not Generic divisions, for we can by no means agree
with those who think every slight variation of sufficient consequence to
form new genera; and in this genus think it more objectionable than in
any other. The title of Protea being derived from the God Proteus of
ever-varying form, the more removed this tribe of plants are in their
externa facie from each other, so much the better do they support their
mythologic title.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

very discriminative appellation; and, although not exclusively the
character of this species, is much more distinctly marked in this plant
than in any other we have as yet seen. Upon comparing our figure with
forty-one species described and figured by Mr. F. Masson, not any
affinity could be discerned powerful enough to render a reference by any
means requisite: there is a sombre appearance annexed to almost all the
flowers of this most curious tribe, and they more resemble pieces of
mechanism than the vegetable productions of nature. They require but
little water in summer, and still less in winter; should be carefully
sheltered from rain and frost, and they will succeed very well, and are
easily propagated by slips from the joints, but very rarely seed in this
country. Natives of the Cape of Good Hope, and are called Stapelias
after a Dutch botanist of the name of Stapel.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

conservatory of G. Hibbert, esq. this month (December), probably not the
regular period of its inflorescence, but the effect of casualty assisted
by the uncommon mildness of the season. It would be a vain endeavour to
attempt to do justice to the beautiful shining silky appearance of the
leaves; and when aided by its delicate purple flowers, its attraction is
equal, if not superior, to any of the genus. The want of freedom in its
flowering is a defect not entirely confined to this species only, but is
in some degree attached to most Sophoras. It is a native of the Cape of

the same, but so different both in the size and colour of its flowers,
that, if it might be regarded as a variety, it must certainly be a very

that, although at present it is a nondescript and very rare plant, it
will, doubtless, soon make its appearance in most collections: its
splendid flowers and easy culture will soon recommend it into general
notice. There are but five species of this genus yet known; the present
subject will therefore be a valuable addition to the number. The falling
off of the leaves is its only defect, which we have no doubt but a
hardier mode of treatment will remove. It is supposed to be a native of

obscure to admit of comparison. The plant, from its long and slender
stalks, acquires a graceful bend when in flower. As a native of Jamaica
it requires the tan-bed of the hot-stove for its protection; and, like
many other tropical plants, is subject to lose much of its beauty by the
loss of the leaves on the lower part of the stem. Our figure was made

immediately after flowering; and for the last three or four years the

least appearance of bloom; and we are inclined to think it might
possibly succeed better with the careful treatment of the dry stove than
with its present situation in the hot-house; and if upon experiment it
should prove successful, it would then doubtless become a plant in

foliage:&mdash;our title may always be ascertained when the plant is in
bloom, whether in perfection or not, as the flowers living or dead
always retain a shining silvery aspect. It also possesses a most
exquisite sweet scent; but its superior fragrance only exists whilst the
flowers are in perfection; as after that period it grows fainter, and is
at last scentless. Our figure was made from the collection of G.
Hibbert, esq.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>This elegant plant is the purple variety mentioned in our last Vol. Pl.
373. and flowered at the same time, with completely double flowers, and
so equal in point of beauty, that we hesitated some time before we could
determine to which we should give the preference. But had we seen the
purple one in its present semi-double state, it would undoubtedly have
claimed precedence, as well from its preserved botanic character, as its
superior beauty. The singular versatility of these plants we were
entirely unacquainted with when we figured the rose-coloured one; as,
since that period, we have seen them in bloom with single flowers, the
following year with double ones; and again the year after we found this
purple one in the semi-double state which our figure represents, the
plant then bearing five-and-twenty flowers in full perfection, forming a

with the careful treatment of the green-house. It is published by Capt.
Hardwicke in his enumeration of the plants of Sireenagur in the Asiatic
Annual Register of 1800, and was found by that gentleman on the sides of
the mountains in fine bloom in the month of December, and from whom it
received the specific title of trigynum. Its provincial name is said to
be Gul Ashorfee; from Gul a flower and Ashorfee gold, a coin current in
India of the value of 2<i>l.</i> sterling. There is a figure of this Linum in
the Exotic Botany of Dr. Smith, copied from a drawing, and represented
with deeply serrated leaves; a character very different from any of the
living plants we have as yet seen in bloom, not one of them exhibiting

we have adopted it. The only place in which we have as yet seen it was
at the Cape nursery last December, where we observed several plants in
fine bloom; and although not showy, they are certainly estimable from
their neat and delicate appearance, particularly at a season when so
many of the beauties of vegetation are in a state of quiescence. Upon
comparing our figure with a fine dried specimen of the D. hirsuta in the
herbarium of A. B. Lambert, esq., we find so powerful a resemblance as
induces us to regard our plant as only a variation of culture, more
especially as in the magnifier slight vestiges of the hairs on the edges
of the leaves are still discernible. But no fear need be entertained of
any mode of culture rendering our present specific term impervious to
the naked eye. There is a dotted or punctured character which pervades
the under surface of the foliage of most Diosmas, many of which, when
rubbed, emit a powerful odour. The present subject, although deficient
in both those respects, still possesses a peculiarity that we have
thought deserving a magnified place in the dissections. It is a hardy
green-house plant, and a native of the Cape of Good Hope.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

the singularity of its unclosing flowers; so uncommon a character
naturally conveying an idea that the plant was in an imperfect state.
Under this prejudice it has lost the charm of novelty, and many a less
attractive object has been preferred before it. This genus approaches so
close to the genera of Hibiscus, Althea, Malva, &amp;c. that it must
certainly be considered as a very near relation to that family. Its
foliage is frequently deciduous on the lower part of the stem; a defect
to which stove plants in general are but too subject. It is a native of
South America and the West India Islands, was found by Dr. Houston in
Jamaica in 1731, and introduced by B. Bewick, esq. in 1780. It flowers

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> appearance of this Protea, as cultivated in the gardens, is
diametrically opposite to its natural character, which, as its specific
indicates, is repent or creeping; instead of which, the branches of the
plant are bent from their natural habit, forced as upright as possible,
and fastened to a stick; in which situation the flowers only would
compare with our figure. But so averse is it to this confined mode of
treatment, that, as soon as the branches are liberated, they instantly
take the direction most natural to them, and which is certainly the most
graceful. Although repens is the more general title of this Protea, yet
we have heard it sometimes called amplexicaulis, a name given by some
cultivators to a plant whose foliage is so nearly resembling the one now
figured, that, when it arrives at a flowering state, it will most
probably prove to be no more than a variation of culture. It is a
difficult matter to say in what stage the flower is most beautiful,
whether in the bud state, before the pointals are released, or
afterwards. From their long confinement, the pollen adheres so strongly
to them, that when relieved they appear like the antheræ. Our drawing
was made at the Hibbertian collection from a plant in fine bloom in the

suffers a light approach with less impunity than this terrific plant;
thus proving the old axiom of an open enemy, however powerful, being
less injurious than a pretended friend, whose insidious character, like
the Hedge Nettle, unheeded stings. In the Hortus Schœnbrunnensis of
Jacquin it is described and figured, and also in the Icones of Plumier,
p. 259, tab. 260, who gives it the additional specific of arborescens:

especially as in the winter season the purple flowers are sometimes
almost bleached by the cold, and the distinction in consequence less
apparent. It is well known by the cultivators under the appellation of

bloom, although an old plant; which is accounted for in the slowness of
its growth, and the size it generally attains to before it becomes a
flowering plant: and as this character is prevalent through the whole
genus, it no doubt prevents them from being so generally cultivated as
they would otherwise be; since, when in flower, they are certainly both
curious and beautiful. Our figure was taken from a plant in the

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> figure of this Eugenia was made from the finest plant in this
country in the hot-house of G. Hibbert, esq. where we were in hopes it
would have perfected its fruit; but were disappointed, as in a very
forward state towards ripening it fell off. But, as far as it was
advanced, we have represented it, as in this climate it might probably
never arrive at greater maturity, unless a larger house were constructed
for it: otherwise the degree of heat necessary to preserve the smaller
tropical plants would always be subject to injure those of a large size,
from the natural extension of their roots approaching too near the
flues. But although so much care is required for it in this clime, in
the warmer regions of Macassar, Amboyna, and the Moluccas, where it is
indigenous, not the least attention is necessary; for, such is the
extreme indolence of the natives, that it is imagined, if any care had
been requisite for its preservation, it would soon have been lost for
want of it. In the Hortus Malabaricus of Rheede there is an uncoloured
figure of it, with descriptions, in which it is said to be a fruit-tree
of great general utility to the country from its extreme abundance,
grateful taste, and salubrious quality, flowering twice in the year. The
fruit in an unripe state is of a bitterish and rather astringent
character; but, when ripe, of a fine flavour, exceedingly wholesome, and
beneficial as an allayer of inflammation in feverish habits. The flowers
are by the Dutch at Amboyna preserved, and frequently eaten by way of
salad. It is said to form a tall umbrageous tree, and when in fine bloom
must certainly be an object of great beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

as yet in cultivation with us. Labillardiere, in his Description of New
South Wales, has given a figure of a plant under the title of
Lasiopetalum triphyllum, very much resembling our quercifolium&mdash;probably
a variety of it&mdash;or, if intended to represent the same plant, there must

minor variety, and which is by some considered as specifically distinct:
and were extension our object, it certainly might be made a separate
species, from the difference of its character after flowering, the
larger one forming a cone the size of an egg; which the lesser one does
not. It also differs in the manner of its growth; but only in the dried
specimens which we have seen that have been collected from old plants at
the Cape; and in them the small variety forms its branches after the
manner of a corymbus, and the plant has thence received the appellation
of corymbosa. But had we given a separate figure of it, we could not
(without making an awkward apology) have adopted a specific title whose
characteristic appearance it might never acquire in this climate, and
which our figure would not have possessed. By placing it amongst the
variations these objections are obviated, and the appearance of
repetition avoided: a desirable object in a genus so extended as Protea;

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> handsome fruit-tree will doubtless soon become an object of general
cultivation in this country, from the brilliance and duration of its
fine scarlet blossoms. It is perfectly hardy, but flowers with most
freedom in the shelter of the green-house. The fruit is about the size
and shape of a walnut. Why or wherefore Pyrus is the generic title
adopted for Apple we were at first at a loss to conjecture, but upon
investigation find it built on the egotism too inseparable from human
nature, and must confess ourselves very sorry to be under the necessity
of placing the defect to its original source; the celebrated Linnæus,
who it appears altered it from Malus (the genus of Tournefort) to Pyrus,
for no other reason but that his own system (unquestionably the best in
almost every other particular) might not bear any resemblance to that of
Tournefort. Jussieu in the Introduction to his Genera Plantarum,
commenting on this very subject, concludes with this most excellent
remark: “Such is the love of undivided praise!” We have therefore
returned the genus back to its old standard, not through any desire to
alter, but absolute necessity; regarding the absurdity of its nomination
under the generic title of Pyrus as already too long retained; for
whilst the tree is known by its fruit, that fruit should certainly be
called by its name.</p>

<p>For the introduction of this fine plant we are indebted to the Hon. C.
Greville, in whose conservatory at Paddington it first flowered, and
from whence our figure was taken.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">For</span> this beautiful species of Pæonia we are indebted to Lady Hume, in
whose select collection at Wormley-bury, Herts, it flowered for the
first time in this country. When we figured the fine purple variety, we
little thought of having so soon to compare it with a rival of such
magnitude, and of equal beauty. The bright radiated purple at the base
is a great relief to the surrounding whiteness of the petals, that would
otherwise stand in much greater need of the assistance of art for a
strength of shadow, that would unavoidably injure their delicacy. The
more we become acquainted with this attractive genus, the greater
latitude of growth we find attached to it, which appears to defy all
systematic rule, varying in some species from Digynia, or two pointals,
up to six or more. The present one differs more than all the rest,
having six pointals and seed-buds attached together, and enshrined
within a globular exterior, resembling a Poppy, and from whence we have
drawn its specific title; for, as a distinct species it may certainly be
considered with great propriety; and most likely the distinction will by
some be thought of sufficient consequence to license a generic division:
but in a genus so mutable, were the alteration still greater, whilst it
could be recognised as a Pæony, we should regret to meet it under any
other title.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

profusely that a stranger can scarcely endure the effluvia of it. The D.

occasionally for the same purpose by the natives. Its scent, when
rubbed, remains a long time, and by some is thought very pleasant, by

very strong perfumes. The foliage has a very neat appearance, and the
clear white flowers give it a lively aspect. Like several others of the

new generic title; but upon examination we find it to be the Lythrum of
Linnæus; in which opinion the author is sanctioned by the concurrence of
some of the ablest botanists of the present day. This handsome shrub is
described in the 4th vol. of the Asiatic Researches, under the native
title of D.hawry, and is said to grow wild on the hills and banks of
rivulets in the northern part of Hindostan, where it is as much esteemed
for its utility as its beautiful red flowers, which are gathered both
for the use of dyers and apothecaries; the latter giving an infusion of
them as a cooling medicine. When used in dyeing, they lose their colour,
and only yield a slight brownish tincture to the water; so that the
benefit derived from them when used with <a id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>Aal seems to depend solely
on their action as an astringent, and which appears to be confirmed by
the substituting of <a id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>Purwas, a strong astringent, as an equivalent for
the flowers of the D.hawry. It is at present treated as a hot-house

treatment of the green-house. The figure was taken from a fine plant in

feathery fringe upon the edges of the imbrication, and the present one
possessing so very slight a characteristic of that description, we could
not with propriety rank it amongst them. Its affinity to the P.
mellifera is only in the honey-bearing character of its flowers, which,
like that species, contain a quantity of nectariferous juice. The
unoccupied term of coronata is adopted, from the resemblance its
imbrication bears to the form of a crown, and which is more apparent in
this species than in any other as yet in cultivation with us. Our figure

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> interesting species of the Orchideæ family was sent from
Switzerland, by Dr. Messear, to the gardens of Isaac Swainson, esq. at
Twickenham, where it flowers annually. It is said to be a native of
Britain, France, Portugal, &amp;c. and is known by the appellation of Ophrys
arachnoides, or spider-like, but is generally thought to bear a stronger
analogy to the humble bee. In the Flora Londinensis of Curtis, there is
a figure under the title of Ophrys fuciflora very much resembling our
plant in most particulars, except in the colour of the flower, which is
very different. The same plant is again figured in Dr. Smith’s English
Botany, under the specific of aranifera; and thus the plant is known
both as a spider and a drone. The arachnoides may therefore be
considered, if not a distinct species, as a very strong marked variety,
and is at present a scarce plant. It remains so long in bloom, that the
author observed it at the nursery of Messrs. Whitley and Brames, three
weeks after he had made the drawing, nearly as perfect as the figure
represents.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

probably the mere effect of climate, and a different mode of culture. As

possess a magnificent exterior of unrivalled beauty; which is by no
means the case: for although it is a grand plant when in fine bloom, the
term of gloriosa must certainly be regarded as a metaphysical hyperbole,
very inapplicable to any plant ever so beautiful. It is indigenous to
North America, and of great utility to the natives, who make cords from
the stringy texture of the leaves, and use it in the fabrication of
their houses, to fasten the ends of them together. Their swinging beds,
called Hamacks, are also said to be made of the same materials; and most
probably the sailor’s bed, so well known by the appellation of Hammock,
derives its title from the Hamack of the Indians. It is easily increased
from the young shoots, which become flowering plants in about five years
in the open ground: but if kept in the green-house, it might remain for
twenty years without blooming, for want of sufficient air and sun to
bring it to maturity.</p>

distinguished; but from Neottia it is separated by the difference of its
habit. This plant is well known by the title of cordigera, a specific

bear to the shape of a heart: but the analogy is certainly not very
powerful. The flowers remain a considerable time in perfection. It is

scented foliage, which when rubbed emits a grateful aromatic odour; and
which the leaves retain in some degree when dried. The flowers, although
not splendid, are perhaps equally estimable from the rarity of their
colour, which is a bright green when in perfection; but in retiring they
acquire a yellower tint. It is a native of New Holland, and requires the
careful treatment of the green-house.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>This fine new Linum was raised from seed by Mr. J. Bell, in whose garden
near Brentford it has flowered for the first time in England. It is
nearest in affinity to the L. hirsutum of Jacquin, under which specific
title the seed was received by Mr. Bell. The flowers when dead or dried
lose their fine pinky tint, and acquire a blueish colour, the same as it
first appears with in the bud state. It might then compare with
Jacquin’s figure in point of colour, but would be too far removed in its
appearance for us to have adopted the specific of hirsutum with any
propriety. We may therefore with justice regard it as a beautiful
nondescript species. It is a native of Mount Caucasus, flowers in June
and July, and seeds so freely that it will no doubt be soon abundantly
cultivated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Crinum latifolium is certainly one of the most attractive of the
genus, as, in addition to the fine red colour of its flowers, it
possesses an aromatic odour of agreeable fragrance. It is a bulb-bearer,
as are all of this genus, although several of them have been placed
erroneously amongst the genus Amaryllis, which does not bear bulbs. The
genus Crinum, at present a short one, will therefore, with a good grace,
admit a few additions; whilst that of Amaryllis, already very extended,
will receive no injury by a slight curtailment. It is a native of the
dry sandy parts of the East Indies, and was introduced by Mr. Lambert in
the year 1803, but has not flowered till this summer&mdash;a period of four
years. But there is little doubt of its now blooming annually, as it is
not uncommon for bulbs imported from a great distance to enjoy a state
of quiescence after their arrival. Our figure was made from a fine plant
in luxuriant bloom in the hot-stove of J. Vere, esq.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> specimen of the Cinchona Caribæa, or Jesuits Bark of Jamaica, was
communicated to the author by A. B. Lambert, esq. who raised it from
seed, and with whom it has flowered for the first time in this kingdom.
Opinions are various as to the time and means by which the medicinal
virtues of the Peruvian bark were first discovered; but as the discovery
of most very useful things is generally the effect of chance, Geoffroy’s
account of it (as given in the Medical Botany of Dr. Woodville) is
certainly the most natural, who states it to have been occasioned by
some Cinchona trees having been blown into a pool of water, and lying
there till the water became so bitter that nobody would drink it, till
one of the neighbouring inhabitants being seized with a violent paroxysm
of fever, and having no other water, drank of this, and was perfectly
cured. He prevailed on some of his friends, who were ill, to make use of
the same remedy, and it proved successful. But the use of it was little
known till the year 1638, when a signal cure being performed on the
Countess del Cinchon, the lady of a Spanish viceroy at Lima, (from whom
it derives its generic title) it came into general use, and a large
quantity of the bark was by that lady distributed amongst the Jesuits,
in whose hands it increased in reputation, and was by them first
introduced into Europe. The Caribæan species is said to be an excellent
substitute for the Peruvian bark, and therefore a most valuable
acquisition to us; as Mr. Lambert, in his description of the genus
Cinchona, informs us that well grounded fears are entertained of the
Peruvian species being some day lost to us, as, from the extreme
decortication they have experienced, they are nearly extinct in those
parts where they were formerly most abundant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

seed, and with whom it has flowered for the first time in this country.
It may with propriety be ranked among the most attractive of the
herbaceous species. The flowers expand in the early part of summer; and
from the cold climate whence it is indigenous, little doubt need be
entertained of its resisting our winter, if it can but endure the sudden
changes of weather to which this island is subject; a transition that
frequently proves more fatal to plants the natives of a cold northern
clime, than to those of southern origin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

herbaceous, as the plant not only dies down annually, but even whilst
living keeps constantly sending up fresh shoots from the root. The white
appearance of the leaves is owing to their being enveloped by a kind of
wool: but there are two varieties; the one whose foliage is almost
without this woolly coat, and the other entirely divested of it, and of
a rich green colour; but in every other particular the plants are all
exactly alike.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> useful plant is the Morus papyrifera of Linnæus, but certainly
would not have been so called by him, had both, the male and female
plant come under his inspection, as it does not belong either to the
class or order of the Mulberry. Neither of the plants, when in bloom,
possesses much beauty, but they have rather a sombre aspect: yet the
female plant, when in fruit, is certainly very handsome. In Japan and
the South Sea Islands, where it is indigenous, the bark of it serves to
make a clothing for the natives. In Japan, it not only makes cloth for
them, but all the Japanese paper is made from the bark of it. There are
four sorts. The first is a royal size, of a square form, very smooth,
and painted on one side. The second is a fine letter paper, in sheets
often three feet long. The third is used for covering their best
varnished articles, and so fine as sometimes to look like a spider’s
web. The fourth is a common writing-paper, varying in size and form. The
process of its manufacture is by cutting off the shoots after the leaves
fall, and boiling them till the bark separates. It is then peeled off,
and steeped 3 or 4 hours in water, to purify, and the black outer
cuticle, and green matter within, are scraped off and separated,
according to their qualities. It is again boiled with a little ashes,
and stirred with a bamboo stick; and the boiling is complete when its
downy fibres can be separated with a touch of the finger. It is then
agitated in water till it appears like a lump of tow, and again beat
with camphor wood battens, and strained, for the coarser paper. An
infusion of the roots of the Hibiscus manihot, or the leaves of Rivaria
Japonica, with the flour of Japan rice, is then mixed with it, and
poured on their moulds; which are not, like ours, formed of wire, but of
fine rushes, and the sheets laid on a matted table with a fine shred of
bamboo between each, and covered by a board with a stone upon it, to
squeeze out the water, dried the next day singly on flat boards, and
then packed up for sale.</p>

genus (as a section of which it would have been much better understood).
The genus Elychrisum we find, upon examination, to be built upon the
same equivocal ground, and there is little doubt but at some future
period those two superfluous genera will fall into the old Linnæan genus
of Xeranthemum. Our figure was made from a fine plant in the Clapham
collection, about a foot and a half high. We have seen it grow much
taller, but it is not then so handsome. It is certainly not a new plant,
but has not been as yet figured in any modern publication. The whiteness
so prevalent in its flowers and leaves (by way of contrast to the green
foliage of most other plants) would render it deserving a place in every
collection, even if its long-lived shining flowers were not a sufficient
recommendation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

opportunity for generic divisions. Nine Genera have already been made by
Dr. Smith and others to contain the Butterfly flowers of New Holland.
Our little novelty agrees with neither. From Pultenæa, Aotus, Mirbelia,
and Dillwynia, it differs in the pod not being two-seeded. The two last
genera have also the cups two-lipped, and the first with appendages
attached to it. Gompholobium has a globular pod, and Chorizema an oblong
one and a bilabiate calyx. Daviesia, Viminaria, and Sphærolobium have
pods one-seeded. Thus situated, we are under the necessity of adding one
more to the number of genera, perhaps already too extended. We have
never seen it exceed a foot in height. The foliage is mostly in whorls:
and the stem, leaves, cups, and fruits are hairy.</p>
